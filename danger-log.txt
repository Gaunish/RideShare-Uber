1) A user may navigate to driver ride search page and mess up the implemented code for driver and vice versa.

2) If a User knows the format of the urls they can search a specific Ride using the primary key. This would allow them to edit/update a Ride or join a Ride as a sharer.

3) A User may also be able to take advantage of specific urls to edit/update a Vehicle.

4) We were having trouble hashing passwords so if our database information has hacked, user passwords may be easily exposed/leaked.

5) We tried to check if User's are logged in when accessing specific pages, but some page checking may have been missed. This would allow incorrect user's access to edit and view database information. 

6) A driver may not have registered vehicle (Update : implemented guarantee in login)

7) A user can changes his/her type into driver and can bypass registering a vehicle.

8) Email is not configured properly to send to all required recipients

9) Datetype format is not specified properly leading to inconsistency, unexpected errors.

10) User/sharer enters negative no of passenger -> unexpected owners.

11) Sharer shouldnt join rides he/she created. they should be mutually exclusive for a ride
